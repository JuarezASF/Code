#TCP ECHO Program - Written in C

This code was removed from the tutorial on http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/sockets.html

TCP is due to the TCP protocol used in the application

ECHO is because the server only seds back the same data received to the client.

Really simple example that ilustrates how to use the socket API with C programming language.
